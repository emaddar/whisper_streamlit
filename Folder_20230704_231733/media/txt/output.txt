 When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the Bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stuart Brand, not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 60s before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polarite cameras. It was sort of like Google and paperback form 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stuart and his team put out several issues of the whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road. The kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words, stay hungry, stay foolish. It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay hungry, stay foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin a new, I wish that for you. Stay hungry, stay foolish. Thank you all very much.
